A Cart becomes an Order after the customer completes the checkout process. Until he/ she does, the transaction is considered a Cart.

Orders aggregate various types of information, namely products, shipping, billing, payment and personal data.

Access Commerce > Orders to fully manage orders and carts. Each order automatically keeps a log of all the actions performed on it, both from the store's and the customer's perspective.
